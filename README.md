## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to set up your development environment.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joshikarank/Image-recognition-in-python.git
   cd Image-recognition-in-python

   Run the web application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to use the image recognition web app.

Usage
Once the web application is running, you can upload an image to be recognized. The deep learning model will classify the image and display the result on the web page.

Training the Model
If you want to train your own image recognition model, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and structure it accordingly.

Create a Python script to build and train your model using TensorFlow and Keras. Example code can be found in the model_training directory.

Save the trained model weights and architecture.

Replace the existing model in the web app (model.h5) with your trained model.

Demo
You can see a live demo of this project at Demo Website.
